Open Web Analytics: Example Module 

Open Web Analytics is an open source web site analytics program. With some
modification, it is possibile to use it for application analytics for the Puppet
Patch Manager web application. However, like many analytics programs, OWA is
mainly designed to say *who* is using your website (which the PPM team already
knows), with only rudimentary reports describing *how* they use it (which PPM
wants to know). Currently, OWA only has a couple reports describing how
frequently certain actions are triggered. Therefore, it is likely that PPM will
want to be able to create customized reports to display the data it needs to
know.

Although there is some documentation on the OWA website, it is very sparse, with
almost nothing about how developers can create customized report pages.
Therefore I have written this example module to show through illustrative
examples how a developer can create a custom module, create custom report pages,
get data from the database, and display in various. Some of these examples use
existing features in the OWA code. Others are more customized.

The best place for developers to start is in the modules/example/module.php
folder. The comments there will explain how modules work, and direct you to
other logical files to look at.
