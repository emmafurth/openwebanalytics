A note about testing on localhosts:

There is a bug in OWA such that the site will not set cookies if you do not
have OWA installed on a fully qualified web domain. That is, if you install 
OWA on local host, and tell it that it is installed on localhost (or give it
an IP address, like 127.0.0.1), OWA will be unable to set cookies properly. 
This means that you will not be able to, for example, log in after 
installation.

To fix this, do the following:
1) Go to your /etc/hosts file and add an alias for your localhost that is 
an FQDN. E.g.: fakedomain.net
2) When installing OWA on your localhost, and it asks for the domain, 
give it the alias. Do NOT include the www. Alternatively, if you are using 
owa-config.php to configure your installation, replace the line
	define('OWA_PUBLIC_URL', 'http://domain/path/to/owa/');
with
	define('OWA_PUBLIC_URL', 'http://fakedomain.net/');
